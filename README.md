# LetsChat
## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Open source Indian Chat app with new cool concepts.

As we all know, the Covid19 pandemic changes the way of education, making everything online as soon as possible. Nowadays, chat apps are evolving. Today, I am introducing you to my new app, "Let's Chat" this will change the game giving the students a platform to interact and collaborate. This app will provide access free to all users for all its features. Through this app, students can message each other, study together, and learn a new way to share notes and stuff. But how is this possible? I am providing these significant features.

### Chat Messenging 
- this feature allows WhatsApp like Messenging where users can create groups and have private chats to interact with each other, asking doubts by sending images, videos, and audio files, etc.( this will also help students to take breaks )
### Group Meetings
- Group Meetings allows users to interact with each other and share files and documents while interacting virtually. Here teachers can conduct doubt sessions, Viva, online meetings smoothly.
### Go Live
 - This will help all the schools and colleges to interact with students and take live online lectures. In this, they can share direct assignments, files, documents, pdf, etc., making the conversation more interactive.
### Library Section 
 - This holds tons of online pdf books. Read, Gain a ton of knowledge. Teachers can create personal libraries where students can access all materials with a secret key provided by teachers.
### AR Camera
- Augmented Reality is changing the way of living. This feature will help students by providing a live simulation of educational concepts. Students can also send beautiful filters applied on their face :) to each other (This will increase the quality of interaction and make people feel interactive)

This app will help all the students interact live while studying and for people in the corporate sector for meetings, etc. My goal is to provide the user with overall access in a single packed app Rather than installing different-different apps for various purposes. Without getting lost while scrolling on Instagram, etc. here, users can manage both Social and Education more efficiently. So that's it. This is my final delta project.
Thank you ðŸ˜Š. Have a Great Day.
